## Next.js Project with Axios, Tailwind, and Node.js
This project is built using Next.js and bootstrapped with create-next-app. It features a form interface and a dashboard that dynamically displays selected details from the submitted form.

## Features
Form Submission: Users can submit details through a form built with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Dashboard: Upon form submission, specific details are automatically displayed on the dashboard.
Axios Integration: The project uses Axios for handling HTTP requests.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind is used for seamless UI styling.
Node.js Backend: The project is powered by a Node.js backend for managing form submissions and processing the data.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Editing the Application
You can start editing the application by modifying the app/page.tsx file. Any changes you make will be auto-updated in the browser.

Axios Setup
Axios is used to handle form submissions to the backend. The API integration can be found in the services folder, where all HTTP requests are managed.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is integrated for styling, making the UI highly customizable. You can find the global styles and any component-specific styles in the styles folder.

Backend (Node.js)
The backend is built using Node.js to process form data and send responses to the frontend. The backend files are located in the api or server folder (depending on your structure).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
